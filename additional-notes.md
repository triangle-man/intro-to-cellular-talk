About 2050

From the Macpherson review [cite]:

Box 2.A: The 2050 Calculator – Department of Energy and Climate Change The 2050
Calculator is a scenario testing tool that allows users to explore different
ways of reducing UK emissions by 2050. It was developed in-house by the
Department of Energy and Climate Change in 2010. To date over 150,000 unique
users have accessed the tool. 

The 2050 Calculator sets a new standard for **transparency**. Both the model and
its assumptions are published on the internet, and during development DECC
published several “Calls for Evidence” and worked with hundreds of
stakeholders. Users are impressed by the open, honest assessment of uncertainty,
improving trust in the model and its insights. Journalists are enthusiastic; the
Guardian calling it ‘...probably one of the most open and transparent pieces of
policy-making ever undertaken by the British government’.

The transparency of the UK calculator led not only to free quality assurance
from global experts in the field, but also tangible diplomatic benefits. For
example, the Chinese Government published their own version of the 2050
calculator – a major breakthrough in transparency and Sino-UK climate change
co-operation.

The team was also formally recognised, winning the Science, Engineering and
Technology Civil Service Award in 2010.
